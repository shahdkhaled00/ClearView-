 ClearView ‚Äì Backend System (ASP.NET Core Web API)
 Overview:
I developed the backend of a vision-care application using ASP.NET Core, focused on building a secure, scalable, and modular architecture. The system handles users (patients), doctors, appointments, vision

Modules I Developed:
 Authentication & Authorization:
‚Ä¢	Implemented secure user registration and login using JWT Tokens.
‚Ä¢	Applied role-based access control for Patients, Doctors, and Admins.
‚Ä¢	Used BCrypt.Net to hash passwords securely.
‚Ä¢	Enabled Google & Facebook login integration (OAuth-ready design).
  User & Doctor Management:
‚Ä¢	Created separate controllers for users and doctors.
‚Ä¢	Built APIs to:
o	View and update user/doctor profile (authenticated user only).
o	Get doctor details by ID.
o	List all available doctors.
‚Ä¢	Applied claims-based identity to fetch user data without sending IDs manually.
   Appointments:
‚Ä¢	Users can book, edit, or cancel appointments with doctors.
‚Ä¢	Doctors can view appointments related to them.
‚Ä¢	Prevented multiple bookings at the same time.
‚Ä¢	Ensured validations and proper error handling.
    Other Features:
‚Ä¢	Linked users with cities, countries, and clinics using lookup tables.
‚Ä¢	Designed all relationships with Entity Framework Core including:
o	Inheritance (Doctor inherits from User).
o	Optional relationships (e.g., User may or may not be linked to a Doctor).
‚Ä¢	Configured CORS, Swagger, and secure environment-based settings.
Tech Stack:
‚Ä¢	Framework: ASP.NET Core Web API
‚Ä¢	ORM: Entity Framework Core
‚Ä¢	Auth: JWT + Roles + Claims
‚Ä¢	Database: SQL Server
‚Ä¢	Documentation: Swagger
‚Ä¢	Security: Password Hashing (BCrypt), Token Validation
‚Ä¢	Design Pattern: Layered Architecture (Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Repositories/DbContext)


My Role:
"I was fully responsible for designing and implementing the backend system. I created and connected all APIs with the frontend team, handled authentication, database structure, and ensured the entire system was secure, maintainable, and scalable."
